## Where do I get tickets?

Advanced tickets for GRTTWaK go on sale exclusively through Tito.

Warning: Advance tickets sell out quickly. Often within hours of going on sale. Act quickly.

A link to buy tickets is always sent ahead of time to members of the mailing list.

## Can I bring something to read?

Yes, please. GRTTWaK is an open-mic event, and it only works when people actually bring things to read. Too many spectators makes for a short and boring night. If you read at GRTTWaK, your admission is free.

Spots are on a  first-come, first-served basis, and if you want to read, you should sign up in advance online. A link to the sign-up sheet will be sent ahead of time to members of the mailing list, and you can find signup links at the event listing.

Please note that only those who sign up in advance will get free admission, and we can’t guarantee a reading spot unless you sign up. That said, it never hurts to bring some childhood writing along, just in case.

## What can I read?

Basically whatever you want, so long as it’s yours and it’s short. Your reading needn’t be funny. It could be bittersweet, or sad, or touching. Here are the three rules that govern what you can read at a GRTTWaK event:

1. You have to be the one who wrote it, as a kid
2. You have to be the one who reads it, as an adult
3. It has to be short (less than 5 minutes)

Time yourself. If you have more than 5 minutes worth of material, pick your favourite piece or two, and read that.

## What does “kid” mean?

Kid = whatever you consider kid to mean. One of the best things about GRTTWaK is the wide variety of things people bring to read. We’ve had stuff from early elementary school all the way up to college age writing. Bring whatever you want.

## What’s the deal with other, similar events? Are they ripping you off? Are you ripping them off? 

There are lots of juvenilia-based events out there, each with their own particular format and execution.

Chronologically, Teen Angst (Vancouver) was the first show like this that we’ve heard of. Mortified’s another. Cringe (NYC) and Salon of Shame (Seattle) and Scribbler Secrets (Charlottetown) are others. Of course, there are similarities. But each show is unique in its execution.

Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids has been around as a live event since 2007, and as a podcast since 2008. There are older shows, and newer shows, and if you ask me, there’s room for more.

Yes.
