So you've signed up to read at _Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids_!

Congratulations and thank you! Here are a few tips to help make the most out of your GRTTWaK experience. They're all important, so please read them carefully.

## Show up early

It's _very_ important that you show up  before we open the doors for general admission. At most events, we ask readers to arrive **no later than 7pm**. When you arrive, check in with Dan or Jenna so we know you made it. We kindly ask that your friends/family/partners wait until general admission doors open (usually at 7:30). Don't worry -- you can save them seats.

## The three rules

There are the rules that govern what you can read at GRTTWaK:

1.  You have to be the one who wrote it, as a kid
2.  You have to be the one who reads it, as a grownup
3.  It must be short (no more than 5 minutes)

## What does "kid" mean?

That's open to interpretation, and we don't have a hard-and-fast age range. Over the years, we've heard little kid writing, college/university-age writing, and everything in between.

Temporal distance matters. Ideally, you should be a decade removed from the material you read. At the very least, you should be in a different stage of life than when you wrote your thing.

## What should I read?

So long as it fits the 3 critera above, pretty much anything. Material that makes you cringe is usually a good place to start. Journals, dairy entries, short stories, and poems are always popular. We also love less-common formats (screenplays, lists, song lyrics).

**Your reading needn’t be funny. **Some of our most memorable readings have been bittersweet, sad, or difficult to share. Stuff that was once _secret_ usually elicits the biggest reactions, even though it can be the scariest material to read aloud. Cuss words are A-OK.

## When am I on?

We usually don't know the lineup until moments before the show begins. During the course of the show, Dan will give readers a heads-up about who's "on deck" (coming up next). If you're on deck, you should make your way towards the font of the room (or backstage, if applicable), and wait to be introduced.

## How should I read my thing?

Dan will introduce you, and everyone will applaud. You come onstage, and read your thing. The audience laughs, cries. etc. Then, everyone applauds again. And that's it. **Please note:** GRTTWaK is not the place to work on your standup act, or promote your next gig, or read your current writing. There are other shows for those things. GRTTWaK is all about adults, reading childhood and teenage writing, as close to verbatim as possible. Please note that none of these are the title of our show:

*   _Grownups Read Lengthy Prepared Introductions to Things They Wrote as Kids_
*   _Grownups Tell Their Entire Life Stories, Then Read Things They Wrote as Kids_
*   _Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids, Pausing Frequently to Make Asides_

If the audience needs to hear a crucial piece of context (e.g. "my sister's name is Laura," "my high school's mascot was a duck"), by all means, include it. But when in doubt: **just read your thing**.

## Should I be nervous?

No way. Remember:

*   Everyone in the audience is rooting for you. There's nobody to win over. They're already on your side.
*   You have a built-in script. No need to be clever on the spot. Just read your thing, and you'll be fine.
*   You don't have to worry about where to put your hands. Your diary/letter/journal/etc. is a built-in prop that'll help keep your hands still.
*   You probably won't be able to see the audience. The lights are super-bright.

There isn't a warmer, more supportive crowd than a GRTTWaK crowd. Honest.

## The time limit

The goal is to keep things short, and keep things moving. You get five minutes to read, maximum. _There is no minimum time limit_.  And yes, you're allowed to read more than one thing, so long as the total length of everything you read isn't longer than five minutes. Beforehand, **practice** reading your thing aloud. Time yourself. If your thing is funny, factor in audience laughter. If your thing is longer than five minutes, pick something shorter, or cut something out. Onstage, it's often hard to know how long you've been reading. At most live events, we'll have a laptop or iPad with a timer on it, so you can check and see how you're doing time-wise.

## Will I be able to read this faded pencil from 30 years ago under the bright stage lights?

Our stages are well-lit. Sometimes, they're so well-lit that it can be difficult to read your childhood writing. Especially if it's small, or written in pencil. **Pro tip: **if your original writing is small or difficult to read, _type out a copy in a large font_, and keep the typed copy inside the original (if indeed you bring along an original copy -- which isn't a requirement).

## Will there be a projector for visuals?

Nope. Sorry.

## Should I post photos of my writing to social media?

Absolutely! Especially if it's full of awesome drawings that are hard to see from a distance. Snap a photo and post it on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids?fref=nf) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/grttwak) or [Instagram](http://instagram.com/grttwak/).

## When will I be on the radio/podcast?

Here's the thing: _you might not end up on the radio/podcast_. Our live shows often run more than 90 minutes, and our podcast episodes run ~30 minutes. We always end up with more great material than we can use in the podcast.

If you don't end up in the podcast, don't take it personally. Very often, live readings have a "you had to be there" moment that doesn't translate to tape. **GRTTWaK is first and foremost a live event.** It's a room full of people getting together to have fun. The radio show and podcast is a consequence, not the cause. Don't think of your reading as an audition for the podcast. It's not.
