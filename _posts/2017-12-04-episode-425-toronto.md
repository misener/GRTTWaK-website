Chris discovers he's gay, Teagan writes poems about Ebola, Ariana falls in love with an older man, and much more. Recorded live at the Tranzac in Toronto.

Ariana's poem in this episode was written at a point in her life when she was "really into slam poetry." Her poem's format was inspired by Kevin Kantor's "Honest Confessions on Letting Go."
