## Grownups Without Borders
We're looking for childhood and teenage writing that has travelled long distances. If you wrote something as a kid, and someone else far away has it, reach out to them. Try to get a copy. And if *you* have something that someone else wrote as a kid, dig it up, so we can surprise them.

Then, [send me an email](mailto:dan@grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com). If we get enough of this stuff, we'll put together a special episode, reconnecting people and places through juvenilia.
