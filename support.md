*Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids* is an independent production, supported by people who want it to exist.

When you become a patron of GRTTWaK, you support the show **directly**. This allows us to organize live events, record stories in as many different places as possible, and produce new podcast episodes in a sustainable way.

## Three levels of support

We have three different levels of patronage, each named after a part of growing up:

<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th>Weird Little Kid</th>
    <th>Awkward Pre-Teen</th>
    <th>Angsty Teenager</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-baqh">
      <a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13328"><i class="fa fa-heart fa-5x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
      <br>
      Support at<br>
      $2/month*
    </td>

    <td class="tg-baqh">
      <a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13327"><i class="fa fa-heart fa-5x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
      <br>
            Support at<br>
      $5/month
    </td>

    <td class="tg-baqh">
      <a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13326"><i class="fa fa-heart fa-5x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
      <br>
            Support at<br>
      $10/month 
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<small>* Weird Little Kids are charged quarterly ($6 every 3 months), to avoid payment processing fees</small>

All levels of patronage are in Canadian dollars, and are set to renew automatically. You can cancel at any time.

## What you get

This isn't a Kickstarter. We don't have t-shirts or tote bags or stretch goals. But, as a way to say thank you, **patrons get early access to a block of advance tickets for each live event**.[^tickets]

## No pressure

Patronage is completely optional. If you'd rather not, or just aren't in a place where you can support the show financially, no worries and no weirdness. Honest. But if you care about GRTTWaK and want to support it, consider becoming a patron today.

# FAQ

## Is this a paywall for the podcast?

No. The podcast is free to download, and patronage is completely optional.

## Is this secure?

Yes. Patronage is handled by [Memberful](https://memberful.com/), and payments are processed through [Stripe](https://stripe.com). You can read more about their online security [here](https://memberful.com/help/general/security/) and [here](https://stripe.com/docs/security). Neither GRTTWaK nor Memberful has access to your credit card data.

## How do I change/manage/cancel my patronage?

Simply [sign in to your Memberful account](https://grttwak.memberful.com/account) using the email address and password you used when you signed up. If you run into trouble, [email Dan](mailto:dan@grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com).

[^tickets]: Don't worry. We'll always have general admission tickets and reader spots available to everyone (patron or not), first-come, first-served. Patronage doesn't guarantee anyone a live event ticket, but it does give supporters of the show first dibs on a small block of audience tickets.
