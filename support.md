*Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids* is an independent production, supported by people who want it to exist.

When you become a patron of GRTTWaK, you support the show **directly**. This allows us to organize live events, record stories in as many different places as possible, and produce new podcast episodes in a sustainable way.


## Three levels of support

We have three different levels of patronage, each named after a phase of growing up:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg .tg-baqh{text-align:center;vertical-align:top}
.fa-heart {
  color: #f37749;
}
</style>


<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th>Weird Little Kid</th>
    <th>Awkward Pre-Teen</th>
    <th>Angsty Teenager</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-baqh">
      <a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13328"><i class="fa fa-heart fa-5x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
      <br>
      <a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13328">Support at<br>
      $2/month*</a>
    </td>

    <td class="tg-baqh">
      <a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13327"><i class="fa fa-heart fa-5x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
      <br>
      <a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13327">Support at<br>
      $5/month</a>
    </td>

    <td class="tg-baqh">
      <a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13326"><i class="fa fa-heart fa-5x" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
      <br>
      <a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13326">Support at<br>
      $10/month</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<small>* Weird Little Kids are charged quarterly ($6 every 3 months), to avoid payment processing fees</small>

All levels of patronage are in Canadian dollars, and are set to renew automatically. You can cancel at any time.

## What you get

Beyond our sincere thanks, and the opportunity to support a thing you love, you also get **early access to tickets for live events**. Live GRTTWaK shows often sell out *very* quickly, and we'll make a special block of tickets available to patrons first.[^tickets]

## No pressure

Patronage is completely optional. If you'd rather not, or just aren't in a place where you can support the show financially, no worries and no weirdness. Honest. But if you care about GRTTWaK and want to support it, consider becoming a patron today.

## One-time options

If you'd prefer a one-time non-recurring way to support the show, we have that too:

- [$5 (one-time, non-recurring)](https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13378)
- [$10 (one-time, non-recurring)](https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13379)
- [$15 (one-time, non-recurring)](https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13380)
- [$25 (one time, non-recurring)](https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13381)
- [$50 (one time, non-recurring)](https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13382)

If you'd like to support the show with another amount, just [email Dan](mailto:dan@grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com).

## Thank you!

*Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids* has always been a grassroots, word-of-mouth kind of thing, and the very fact that you're reading these words means a *lot.* If you're considering becoming a patron, thank you. We couldn't do GRTTWaK without you.
