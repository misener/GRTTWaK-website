*Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids* is a live, open-mic reading series, recorded for audio broadcast. This document details our live sound requirements, and explains our recording setup. If you have any questions, please <a href="mailto:dan@grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com">contact Dan by email</a>.

## What you supply, what we bring

GRTTWaK travels with the following audio gear:

- <a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/beta/beta-87a-vocal-microphone">Shure Beta 87A</a> microphone (shared by host and readers)
- <a href="http://www.rode.com/microphones/ntg-2">Rode NTG2</a> shotgun microphone (for recording audience reaction)
- <a href="https://www.zoom-na.com/products/field-video-recording/field-recording/h6-handy-recorder">Zoom H6</a> multi-track recorder
- <a href="http://www.radialeng.com/proms2.php">Radial Engineering ProMS2</a> passive microphone splitter

We require the following from venues:

- 1x adjustable microphone stand, centre stage. This microphone stand must be in good working order, easily adjustable to accommodate various reader heights. A one-hand clutch style stand is preferred. A tripod boom mic stand will also work if a one-hand clutch style stand is unavailable.
- 2x microphone stands (any style, the taller the better) to mount a shotgun microphone and a small video camera
- 3x 15-25' XLR cables for use on stage
- A small table and chair on stage
- A tablecloth (preferably black)

## Live sound
Our live sound reinforcement needs are minimal. We’re single-mic setup.

However, because we often have 15–20 readers on stage in rapid succession, we need an audio tech to ride each reader’s level in real-time. Before the show, our host will prep readers on microphone technique.

Signal from a single Beta 87A is split onstage using the ProMS2. One feed goes directly into GRTTWaK’s recording setup (described above). The other feed (transformer isolated) goes to the house mixer. <strong>That’s it.</strong>

Many of our readers are not used to being on stage. Monitors often freak them out. <strong>We do not require monitors.</strong>
<h2>Recording</h2>
All recording is handled by our host (Dan) who remains on stage throughout the show.
<h2>Sound check</h2>
For most live events, GRTTWaK load-in is at 5:30, with sound check at 6:00. Because readers arrive between 6:30–7:00, it’s especially important that sound check happen on time.
