*Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids* is a live, open-mic reading series, recorded for audio broadcast. This document details our live sound requirements, and explains our recording setup. If you have any questions, please <a href="mailto:dan@grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com">contact Dan by email</a>.

## What you supply, what we bring

GRTTWaK travels with the following audio gear:

- <a href="https://www.sounddevices.com/products/recorders/mixpre-3">Sound Devices MixPre-3</a> field recorder
- <a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/beta/beta-87a-vocal-microphone">Shure Beta 87A</a> microphone (shared by host and readers)
- 2x <a href="http://www.rode.com/microphones/nt5">Rode NT5</a> condenser microphones (for recording audience reaction)
- <a href="http://www.radialeng.com/product/proms2/">Radial ProMS2</a> Passive Microphone Splitter for splitting reader mic to house console + recording setup
- <a href="http://www.radialeng.com/product/trim-two/">Radial Trim-Two</a> Passive Stereo Direct Box (for sending pre-show music from iPad)
<!-- - 1x <a href="http://www.rode.com/microphones/ntg-2">Rode NTG-2</a> shotgun microphone (for recording audience reaction) -->

We require the following from venues:

- 1x adjustable microphone stand, centre stage. This microphone stand must be in good working order, easily adjustable to accommodate various reader heights. A one-hand clutch style stand is preferred. A tripod boom mic stand will also work if a one-hand clutch style stand is unavailable.
- 4x additional microphone stands (any style, the taller the better) to mount audience reax microphones and a small video camera
- 6x 15-25' XLR cables for use on stage
- A small table and chair on stage
- A tablecloth (preferably black)

## Live sound
Our live sound reinforcement needs are minimal. However, because we often have 15–20 readers on stage in rapid succession, we need an audio technician to ride each reader’s level in real-time. Before the show, our host will prep readers on microphone technique.

We'll send your console two sources via XLR:

1. A transformer-isolated split from the main reader microphone (via Radial ProMS2)
2. Pre-show and intermission music (iPad via Radial Trim-Two)

## Monitors
Many of our readers are not used to being on stage. Monitors often freak them out. <strong>We do not require monitors.</strong>

<h2>Recording</h2>
All recording is handled by our host (Dan) who remains on stage throughout the show.

<h2>Sound check</h2>
For most live events, GRTTWaK load-in is at 5:30, with sound check at 6:00. Because readers arrive between 6:30–7:00, it’s especially important that sound check happen on time.
