The *Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids* podcast reaches 50,000 regular listeners. Many are [effusive in their praise](http://feeds.grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com/reviews).

The show has been named an iTunes "Best Of" each year we've been in production, and one time we even won a [fancy-shmancy international broadcasting award](http://www.newyorkfestivals.com/worldsbestradio/2015/pieces.php?iid=490490&pid=1).

Each bi-weekly episode has room for a single sponsorship, which includes:

- A live read by our host Dan, based on a prepared script or bullet points from you. This appears immediately after each episode's cold open and introduction.
- A link and a short description at the bottom of each episode's show notes

Podcast sponsorships are exclusive. Only one sponsor per episode.
