<p>We‚Äôre looking for childhood and teenage writing that has travelled long distances. If you wrote something as a kid, and someone else far away has it, reach out to them. Try to get a copy. And if <em>you</em> have something that someone else wrote as a kid, dig it up, so we can surprise them.</p>

<p>Then, <a href="mailto:dan@grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com">send me an email</a>. If we get enough of this stuff, we‚Äôll put together a special episode, reconnecting people and places through juvenilia.</p>
