I"­<p><em>Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids</em> is a live, open-mic reading series, recorded for audio broadcast. This document details our live sound requirements, and explains our recording setup.

<p>GRTTWaK travels with the following audio gear:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.sounddevices.com/products/recorders/mixpre-3">Sound Devices MixPre-3</a> field recorder</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/beta/beta-87a-vocal-microphone">Shure Beta 87A</a> microphone (shared by host and readers)</li>
  <li>2x <a href="http://www.rode.com/microphones/nt5">Rode NT5</a> condenser microphones (for recording audience reaction)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.radialeng.com/product/proms2/">Radial ProMS2</a> Passive Microphone Splitter for splitting reader mic to house console + recording setup</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.radialeng.com/product/trim-two/">Radial Trim-Two</a> Passive Stereo Direct Box (for sending pre-show music from iPad)
<!-- - 1x <a href="http://www.rode.com/microphones/ntg-2">Rode NTG-2</a> shotgun microphone (for recording audience reaction) --></li>
</ul>

<p>We require the following from venues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1x adjustable microphone stand, centre stage. This microphone stand must be in good working order, easily adjustable to accommodate various reader heights. A one-hand clutch style stand is preferred. A tripod boom mic stand will also work if a one-hand clutch style stand is unavailable.</li>
  <li>4x additional microphone stands (any style, the taller the better) to mount audience reax microphones and a small video camera</li>
  <li>6x 15-25â€™ XLR cables for use on stage</li>
  <li>A small table and chair on stage</li>
  <li>A tablecloth (preferably black)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="live-sound">Live sound</h2>
<p>Our live sound reinforcement needs are minimal. However, because we often have 15â€“20 readers on stage in rapid succession, we need an audio technician to ride each readerâ€™s level in real-time. Before the show, our host will prep readers on microphone technique.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll send your console two sources via XLR:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A transformer-isolated split from the main reader microphone (via Radial ProMS2)</li>
  <li>Pre-show and intermission music (iPad via Radial Trim-Two)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="monitors">Monitors</h2>
<p>Many of our readers are not used to being on stage. Monitors often freak them out. <strong>We do not require monitors.</strong></p>

<h2>Recording</h2>
<p>All recording is handled by our host (Dan) who remains on stage throughout the show.</p>

<h2>Sound check</h2>
<p>For most live events, GRTTWaK load-in is at 5:30, with sound check at 6:00. Because readers arrive between 6:30â€“7:00, itâ€™s especially important that sound check happen on time.</p>
