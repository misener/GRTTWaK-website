I"“	<p>Of course, so long as you call it something other than <em>Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids</em>, to avoid confusion.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>GRTTWaK isnâ€™t a franchise. Itâ€™s a tiny passion project run by a married couple, part-time, evenings and weekends. Weâ€™ve been organizing GRTTWaK shows for almost a decade and in that time, weâ€™ve developed enough esoteric ways of doing things that franchising just isnâ€™t feasible right now.</p>

<p>Of course, that shouldnâ€™t stop you from putting your own unique spin on a juvenilia-reading event. Nobody owns the idea of sharing cute/funny/embarassing juvenilia on stage, and there are <strong>lots</strong> of other events where people read childhood/teenage diaries, poetry, short stories, etc.</p>

<p>Chronologically, Sarah Bynoeâ€™s <a href="http://sarabynoe.com/shows/teen-angst/">Teen Angst Night</a> (Calgary, then Vancouver) was the first event like this weâ€™ve heard of. <a href="getmortified.com">Mortified</a> is another. <a href="http://www.queserasera.org/cringe.html">Cringe</a> (NYC and London) and <a href="http://salonofshame.com/">Salon of Shame</a> (Seattle) and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DearDiaryShow">Dear Diary</a> (Toronto) are others. Obviously, there are similarities between these events, but each is unique in its format and execution.</p>

<p>Ariel from <a href="http://salonofshame.com/">Salon of Shame</a> wrote a great how-to guide called <a href="http://salonofshame.com/start-your-own/">Start a diary reading event in your town!</a> Also, Mortifiedâ€™s FAQ has some good advice about making your event unique (scroll down to â€œ<a href="http://getmortified.com/about/faq/">Can I do a Mortified-inspired show in my city if I call it something else?</a>â€).</p>

<p>Finally, if you start your own GRTTWaK-inspired reading event, <a href="mailto:dan@grownupsreadthingstheywroteaskids.com">let us know</a>. Weâ€™re always keen to hear from kindred spirits, and weâ€™re happy to help wherever we can.</p>
