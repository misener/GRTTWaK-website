I"¿<p><em>Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids</em> is an independent production, supported by people who want it to exist.</p>

<p>When you become a patron of GRTTWaK, you support the show <strong>directly</strong>. This allows us to organize live events, record stories in as many different places as possible, and produce new podcast episodes in a sustainable way.</p>

<h2 id="three-levels-of-support">Three levels of support</h2>

<p>We have three levels of patronage, each named after a phase of growing up:</p>

<p><small>* Weird Little Kids are charged quarterly ($6 every 3 months), to avoid payment processing fees</small></p>

<p>All levels of patronage are in Canadian dollars, and are set to renew automatically. You can cancel at any time.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-get">What you get</h2>

<p>Beyond our sincere thanks, and the opportunity to support a thing you love, you also get <strong>early access to tickets for live events</strong>. Live GRTTWaK shows often sell out <em>very</em> quickly, and weâ€™ll make a special block of tickets available to patrons first.<sup id="fnref:tickets" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:tickets" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="no-pressure">No pressure</h2>

<p>Patronage is completely optional. If youâ€™d rather not, or just arenâ€™t in a place where you can support the show financially, no worries and no weirdness. Honest. But if you care about GRTTWaK and want to support it, consider becoming a patron today.</p>

<h2 id="one-time-options">One-time options</h2>

<p>If youâ€™d prefer a one-time non-recurring way to support the show, we have that too:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13378">$5 (one-time, non-recurring)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13379">$10 (one-time, non-recurring)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13380">$15 (one-time, non-recurring)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13381">$25 (one time, non-recurring)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://grttwak.memberful.com/checkout?plan=13382">$50 (one time, non-recurring)</a></li>
</ul>
