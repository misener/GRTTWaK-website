Since 2007, brave adults across Canada have shared their own weird and wonderful childhood and teenage writing at *Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids*, a live, onstage storytelling event.

The show’s primary goal is to entertain. But beyond that, the aim is to invite everyone — readers, live audience members, and radio/podcast listeners — to reflect on their own lives, to connect with who they used to be, and to draw a line that connects the past and the present.

Embarrassing, moving, and hilarious, these readings are powerful reminders of who we used to be. They’re compelling stories, at once deeply personal, yet surprisingly universal.

## How it all began

Dan here. Let me tell you a story.

It was Christmas 2006, and my girlfriend Jenna (now my wife) and I were visiting her parents in Kingsville, Ontario. Jenna’s parents asked her to clear out some of the boxes she still had stored in the basement.

Going through those boxes, we discovered Jenna’s early teenage diary, written in those awkward years when she was just on the edge of puberty. With drinks in hand, we spent the better part of the afternoon reading diary entries out loud to one another. Some were funny. Some were bittersweet. But the thing that struck me most was how Jenna’s diary gave me a glimpse into a past I’d never seen before.

We figured that lots of other people probably had their childhood and teenage writing kicking around somewhere — in their parents’ basements, in boxes in the closet, in storage lockers…

So I asked my mom to send me some of my childhood schoolwork. Then we booked a night upstairs at the Victory Cafe in Toronto, invited some friends, and crossed our fingers. People showed up. We had some drinks. We laughed. And we’ve been doing live shows ever since.

## What’s the story with the podcast and radio show?

From the very beginning, Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids has been a hobby. The live events are a side project, done after-hours, outside my day job at CBC Radio.

In 2008, we started releasing individual stories as a podcast, which lasted for 18 episodes before running out of steam.

Then, in 2009, I pitched a 10-part summer radio series to CBC. I made a pilot that year, but the series never happened, and the idea was shelved.

Then in late 2013,  I dusted off that pilot and re-pitched Grownups Read Things They Wrote as Kids to CBC. This time, they bit. During the summer of 2014, I travelled across the country, putting on live shows and turning them into radio with my CBC colleague Alison Broverman. We made 10 episodes for CBC. Then the summer ended.

We wanted to keep making episodes, so in December 2014, Jenna and I announced  we were going to make the second season of the podcast independently. And so it’s been, ever since.
